* Random stuff.

   - [[file:Sudoku.org][Sudoku]]: In which I use dancing links to solve Sudoku.
   - [[file:searching-delimited-log-files.org][sed]]: In which I make an overly complicated sed script.
   - [[file:ChangeForDollar.org][Change for a Dollar]]: In which I come up with a bad way to solve
     the change for a dollar problem.
   - [[file:luhn.org][Luhn Checking]]: In which I switch doubling and adding digits with
     a lookup table.
   - [[file:cube-permutations-1.org][Playing with a Rubik's Cube]]: In which I confirm that a
     "permutations" view the toy works.
   - [[file:CodeAsData.org][Code as Data]]: My attempt at exploring why that means something in
     lisp.
   - [[file:generating-polyominos.org][Generating Polyominos for Tiling]]: How many ways can you tile a
     board with polyominos?
   - [[file:generating-free-polyominos.org][Generating Free Polyominos]]: Same as last time, just no longer
     with a tetris mindset.

     construct a tree given the in-order and pre-order values of it.
   - [[file:trading-with-bdds.org][Trading with BDDs]]: In which I almost certainly butcher my first
     attempt at using a binary decision diagram


* I'm probably wrong.

   - [[file:sum-types.org][Sum Types and Visitors]]: In which I make a bad argument with nobody.
