<p>
I hesitate to call this a book review, as I don't really even know how
to do a book report anymore.  Been far far too long.  At any rate, as
I try to get a hold of my path in programming and how I can contribute
to things, I did find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staff-Engineers-Path-Tanya-Reilly-ebook/dp/B0BG16Y553">The Staff Engineer's Path</a> a compelling read.
This will be my attempt at reflecting on why.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org32c1675" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org32c1675">Getting started</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org32c1675">
<p>
The book starts with a fun set of explorations on the idea of "where
do you see yourself in five years?"  As in the book, I view this as
mainly having socially acceptable answers.  I am not sure I agree with
thinking of this as a serious question.  This view of mine has only
grown more as I have grown a family.
</p>

<p>
I do, at least, find comfort that the exploration admits to just how
similar senior positions are.  That said, I found that the book does a
lot to weaken the general idea that we are seriously looking at viable
paths to meaningful tenure for individual contributor style positions.
</p>

<p>
My gripes start in the introduction.  It is not hard to reframe all of
the "pillars" into essentially getting lucky for far too many people.
Worse, they are framed in a very "just so" style for why things are
more important and need "more seniority."
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org02aee23" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org02aee23">My understanding of a staff level position, per the book.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org02aee23">
<p>
The book lays out a general framework for how knowledge and experience
are foundations for holding up "big picture thinking," "project
execution," and "leveling up" as pillars to "Impact."
</p>

<p>
Yes, this is clearly intentionally vague and somewhat hand wavy and at
face value, I don't mind that.  Perspective does give way to keeping
things hand wavy so that you don't find people only running checklists
for what is expected of them.  "Fly casually" perfectly captures the
general idea for many things.
</p>

<p>
However, I never really got a concrete sense of what was intended.
The best I came away with was that staff engineers are those that
worked on successful projects.  But, that is a very unsatisfactory
explanation to me.  In large because it is trivial to see that the
paths outlined in this book are insufficient to explain so many
successful people and projects.
</p>

<p>
Worse, though, is that the straw man scenarios dreamed up to justify
many of the assertions are painfully dry.  To the point that I just
can't find inspiration in them.  Nor can I see generalizations that
seem promised.
</p>

<p>
More personally, I've been on successful projects where people got
promoted and everyone had to live with the complexity that they
demanded so that they could get that promotion.  I think it is equally
a straw man to say that we solely promote complexity, but I have to
acknowledge I've seen a lot of real life straw men.  (I think this is
a valid check against me, that I cannot dismiss the talking in this
book as only straw man.)
</p>

<p>
By the end of the book, I think I have come to an understanding that
"staff" level positions are viewed heavily as public performance
positions.  Not in a negative way, but the role seems easiest to
summarize as "people that are willing to do things publicly, have had
successes, and are generally able to get teams to work together."
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6cb33fb" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6cb33fb">My first major disagreement</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6cb33fb">
<p>
I should confess that my first real disagreement came from a sidebar
about titles.  At large, I don't have a lot of respect for
hierarchies.  Which tends to mean I don't have too much respect for
bolstering titles.
</p>

<p>
Up front, I certainly agree that titles matter to some people.
Usually, though, they mainly only matter at the extremes.  This is all
the more true for titles that are not tied to accomplishments or
direct responsibilities.  If you are at a small company and called
"Principal Engineer," what does that really tell me about what you are
capable of or responsible for?  I used to be at a large company and
even there I couldn't really tell you what it meant.
</p>

<p>
Now, I do not intend this as a criticism of anyone that allows titles
to be given, but I have to acknowledge my bias against the idea.  Have
I worked with some amazing "Principal" level engineers?  Absolutely.
But I have also worked with some that I felt did their best to
complicate the situation to an obvious stallout.  Such that the title
alone isn't enough to prime me for what to expect.
</p>

<p>
More telling, the best principal engineer I ever had the privilege to
work with did not seem to care what anyone's title in the room was.
Such that even agreeing that care should be taken in giving out
titles, I view that largely as yet another bias that should be worked
against.  Not built upon.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbb21279" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbb21279">Does anyone really work places where local maximums rule?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbb21279">
<p>
Back to the first section, then, the need for "staff engineers" was
mainly outlined as "for the overall good of the company, over the
local desires of a team."  That is, A large part of the need for "big
picture thinking" was to make sure decisions were contextualized so
that choices are made that maximize value across the company.  The
idea being that many teams would normally choose their cheapest
option, even if that was not the best value for the everyone.
</p>

<p>
I can confess that I have seen a few choices like this made.  However,
not nearly as often as is usually put forth.  Far too often, teams are
so lean in staffing and resources that they aren't choosing a cheap
option for the sake of being cheap, but for the sake of survival and
progress.
</p>

<p>
I hesitate to flat out dismiss this idea, but it would be more
compelling with larger examples of success from such choices.  Maybe I
missed them, but I don't remember any.  Instead, it was your general
charts showing value of the two choices available, with the obvious
"you should pick the bigger value."
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9fccbb5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9fccbb5">Winning friends and influence</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9fccbb5">
<p>
So much of the rest of the book feels like a distillation of how to
navigate in a political environment.  From looking at where you sit in
an overall organization hierarchy to knowing who to talk to in other
parts of the company.
</p>

<p>
To be clear, I think a lot of this is good advice.  I do think keeping
perspective on who you are talking to is important.  I also think it
is a great idea to build channels of communication between groups that
aren't talking, for some reason.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure any of this should be confined to "staff" level
developers, though.  Certainly, entry level positions are best kept
from having to find everything out on their own.  They can still be
given opportunities to do so, though.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, the sections that go over political capital and costs are
things that are easier for established people.  A brand new person on
a team will almost certainly not have the reputation necessary to have
given them political capital in an organization.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcccbf50" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgcccbf50">I almost stopped reading about writing a document</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcccbf50">
<p>
My largest gripe on the entire book was the entire section about
writing a document.  This section started out appealing to me with a
general idea of getting a vision created.  I was thinking it would be
like an earlier piece on writing a "personal scope document" about
where you feel you fit in.
</p>

<p>
I do think a general set of guiding principles is a great idea.  I
further enjoy the idea of trying to make a narrative of what is being
targetted.  So many things can fall apart trying to make sense of them
in a narrative, such that you can save a ton of development time by
realizing you don't actually have a destination.
</p>

<p>
But, I lost the train when sections are justifying the need to have a
director level sponsor for the document.  And having a team built for
the purpose of building the document.  Which ostensibly is for the
purpose of building something else?
</p>

<p>
Again, it isn't that I even disagree with the general idea.  Yes, you
need leadership buyin on anything that you are wanting to push for.
Yes, you should have a general vision.  Yes, you should plan out what
you are going to do.  You should have a general idea of what you will
do when you progress to certain points.  All great points.
</p>

<p>
However, I have yet to ever work on anything that was kicked off with
a multi month document building process that did not immediately stall
out or find that it was, at best, solving last year's problems.
Worse, when these documents are treated as the public performance that
they are, it is common for them to be packed with aspirational
requirements that are not based on learned necesseties.
</p>

<p>
That last point, I believe, is why we get so much of what is commonly
called "cargo cult engineering."  People see a solution that worked
somewhere else and immediately try to graft either that solution, or
their situation, into a place it may or may not fit.  And then you get
so coupled to a vision of what people wanted to be able to build, that
you are not ready or capable to pivot out.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcceeded" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgcceeded">I do still recommend the book</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcceeded">
<p>
Despite my grievances on titles and teams to build a document, I think
I still recommend the book.  The general idea of trying to get better
still resonates very well and there are plenty of sections that I
think can be molded to many situations a developer is likely to find
themselves in.
</p>

<p>
I also think I should be challenged on the parts I disagree with.
Such that I would be delighted to have anyone give examples of where
these things actually worked out in the wild.
